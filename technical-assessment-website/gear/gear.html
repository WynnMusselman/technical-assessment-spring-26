                <h3>Foil</h3>
                <div class = "weapon-gear">
                    <div class = "gear-text">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Foil</i>
                                <br>
                                The weapon used in foil, a foil, is more lightweight than the other 
                                weapons. There is a button on the tip of the blade which needs to be 
                                clicked in order for a point to be scored. The bell guard is also the 
                                smallest compared to the three weapons. This is because the hand and 
                                arms are not target area, so the bell guard does not need to protect 
                                anything.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Glove</i>
                                <br>
                                In foil and epee, the glove is the same. It is worn on just the fencer's 
                                dominant hand and does not have any conductive area. It is used to 
                                protect the hand.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Mask</i>
                                <br>
                                Since the bib of the mask covers part of the torso, which is target area, 
                                that area of the mask is conductive. This means that the bib has the same 
                                silver, conductive material of the lame. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Lame</i>
                                <br>
                                The lame is the silver, conductive jacket that covers just the target area. 
                                In foil, it just covers the torso.
                            </li>

                                <br>
                                In foil specifically, the chest protector needs to be covered in a soft 
                                material. This is to prevent foils from deflecting off of the hard surface 
                                of a chest protector.  
                            </li>

                            This is to protect the wrist and to allow the fencer's hand to 
                            slide down the handle more easily to gain further extension.

                                <br>
                                The weapon used in saber is a saber. Since points can be scored with any 
                                part of the saber, not just the tip, the weapon is used for slashing most 
                                often. The guard is big and rounded, which protects the wrist since it is 
                                valid target area. 
                            </li>

                                <br>
                                The glove in saber is mostly the same as the glove in foil and epee. The only 
                                difference is that the wrist has a conductive area on it since it is target area.

                                Since the entire head is target area, the whole mask is conductive.

                                The silver, conductive lame covers both the torso and the sleeves.

                <h3>Epee</h3>
                <div class = "weapon-gear">
                    <div class = "gear-text">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Epee</i>
                                <br>
                                The epee is slightly heavier than a foil and has a large guard to protect the hand, 
                                which is target area. Just as with foil, you score touches in epee by using the 
                                tip of the blade. There is a button on the end of an epee blade that needs to be 
                                clicked for a touch to register.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <br>
                                The glove in epee is the same as the foil glove. Since the full body is target area, 
                                none of the equipment has the silver, conductive material on it. Instead, a touch 
                                always registers as a point, no matter where it lands.

                                Similarly to the epee glove, masks have no conductive area on them.
