                <h1>Disciplines</h1>
                <p>In fencing there are three disciplines: foil, saber, and epee. 
                    Each discipline comes with its own rules on touches, target area, and right 
                    of way that will be explained on this page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something to note while reading is 
                    that each weapon used in a specific discipline shares the same name as that
                    discipline. For example, the 
                    weapon used in foil is just called a foil.
                </p>

                <!-- foil -->
                 <br>
                 <h2>Foil</h2>
                 <div class = "disciplines-info">
                    <!-- foil text -->
                    <div class = "disciplines-text">
                        <h3 id ="foil-touches">Touches</h3>
                        <p>
                            On the tip of a foil and epee blade, there is a small button that, when clicked, 
                            signals to the scoring machine that a touch has occurred. If a fencer
                            clicks this button by striking the tip of their weapon against their opponent's 
                            conductive target area, then they may have scored a 
                            point. If their blade's button hits a non-target area, the scoring machine
                            registers this touch "off target" and the fencers reset to wherever the 
                            off target touch occured. If two fencers make a touch at the same time, then the rules 
                            of right of way need to be considered.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Target Area</h3>
                        <p>
                            Foil has the most limited target area out of the three styles. Only the torso
                            is considered target area, which is covered by the silver, conductive lame and conductive 
                            part of the mask. This 
                            means that a fencer can only score a point if the tip of their foil touches 
                             between their opponent's shoulders to their hips. Because of the 
                            accuracy and point control needed when fencing foil, it is often the discipline
                            that beginners start with. Foil teaches beginner fencers to be more precise and 
                            accurate, which is useful for any style of fencing.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 id = "foil-ROW">Right of Way</h3>
                        <p>Right of way is often the most confusing part of fencing for people to comprehend. 
                            Even more advanced fencers struggle with this concept. In foil and saber, right of way are 
                            the rules that assert whether you or your opponent scored the point when you 
                            get a touch at the same time. If a fencer is attacking, they want to have 
                            gained right of way so that when they touch their opponent, they are certain that 
                            the point is there's. Right of way can be gained in a few ways:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Exending your arm before the opponent, which initiates the attack.</li>
                                <li>Parrying (blocking) the opponent's blade. This should then be followed by 
                                    a riposte (parry then touch) to gain a point.
                                </li>
                                <li>Extending your arm and then holding it (point-in-line).</li>
                                <li>Beating the opponent's blade to intiate an attack.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </div>

                            In this image, you can see that the silver conductive area covers just the 
                            fencers' torsos. This conductive area signifies the target area 
                            for foil!

                            This is a picture of me fencing foil at a competition at Carnegie Mellon University. 
                            My teammates and I wore matching cow socks!
                        </p>

                <!-- Saber -->
                 <br>
                 <h2>Saber</h2>
                <div class = "disciplines-info">
                    <!-- saber text -->
                    <div class = disciplines-text>
                        <h3>Touches</h3>
                        <p>
                            In saber, the whole blade is conductive. This means that a fencer can score a point
                            whenever any part of the blade touches the opponent's target area. Slashing is the primary
                            way of scoring touches as a result. Unlike in foil, there is no such thing as an off target
                            call. This means that if a fencer touches something off target with their blade, the round
                            continues as normal and the scoring machine does not register that a touch occurred. If two
                            fencers get a touch at the same time, then the rules of right of way need to be considered.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Target Area</h3>
                        <p>
                            Saber has a bigger target area than in foil, but still less than epee. The top of the head to 
                            the hips is considered target area. This includes the fencer's arms and full mask.
                            Saber fencers wear a silver lame that covers this section of their body. This target 
                            area is meant to simulate a cavalry rider on top of a horse!
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Right of Way</h3>
                        <p>
                            Right of way is the same in saber as it is in foil. Refer to <a href = "#foil-ROW">foil's right of

                            In this image, you can see the silver conductive area on each fencer covers
                            their torso, arms, and mask. This signifies their target area.

                        <h3>Touches</h3>
                        <p>
                            Touches are scored the same way in epee as they are in foil. There is a button 
                            on the tip of the blade that allows you to score a touch. Refer to 
                            <a href = "#foil-touches">foil's touches section</a> to learn more.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Target Area</h3>
                        <p>
                            Epee has the largest target area of the three disciplines. The target area is the 
                            whole body, including the head, feet, and hands! The epee's bell guard is designed 
                            to be very large as a way to cover the hand as it is part of the target area. Since 
                            the whole body is target area, epee fencers do not wear a silver lame at all. When 
                            anything is touched in epee, this registers as a point. If a fencer touches something 
                            that is not target area, such as the ground, the scoring machine will
                            register it as a point, but the referee will throw it out. This means that epee also does 
                            not have "off-target" like foil does. Because of the large target area, epee is most often 
                            the style you will see in movies and tv!

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Right of Way</h3>
                        <p>
                            In epee, there is no right of way. If both fencers get a touch at the same time, then they 
                            are both awarded a point. 
                        </p>
