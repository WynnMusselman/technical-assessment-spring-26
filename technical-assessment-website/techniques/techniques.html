                <h1>Techniques</h1>
                <p>
                    In fencing, there are many different techniques that help you move down the strip, 
                    attack your opponenet, or defend yourself. Some of these techniques are used constantly 
                    in every style of fencing while others are used sparingly in just one discipline. This page 
                    will go over just a few of the most fundamental techniques: on guard, advancing, retreating, 
                    lunging, and parrying.
                </p>

                <!-- on guard -->
                <h2>On Guard</h2>
                <p>
                    On guard is the ready stance used before the bout begins. 
                    <br>
                    First, you stand with your heels 
                    together, but perpendicular. They should make an "L" shape with your dominant foot facing 
                    toward your opponent. Next, step out with your front foot so your heels are shoulder width 
                    apart. Then, bend your knees slightly. Your feet and legs are now in the correct position!
                    <br>
                    Now, your dominant arm should be slightly bent outward, facing your opponent. Your front elbow
                    should be about a fist away from your body. Your back arm needs to be behind your body as to 
                    not block target area. There is no correct way to keep your back arm when fencing, just make sure 
                    it is not in front of you and it's in a comfortable position.
                    <br>
                    Make sure while on guard that your back is straight and your weapon is aimed at your opponent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On guard is used in fencing as it maintains balance and decreases the amount of target area.
                </p>

                <!-- advance -->
                <h2>Advance</h2>
                <p>
                    The advance is the most basic forward movement a fencer makes. To advance, a fencer 
                    first stands in on guard position. Next, you raise your front toes and then step forward
                    while landing on your heel. Once your heel hits the ground, the back leg can then move 
                    forward as well. The front foot's toes and the back foot should land on the ground at 
                    the same time. 
                </p>

                <!-- retreat -->
                <h2>Retreat</h2>
                <p>
                    The retreat is the movement fencers make to go backwards. It is similar to the advance, 
                    but in the opposite direction. In on guard position, move the back foot backward first. 
                    You should land with the ball of your back foot first. Then, the front foot follows. The 
                    front foot and the heel of the back foot should land at the same time. 
                </p>

                <!-- Lunge -->
                <h2>Lunge</h2>
                <p>
                    Lunging is one of the most important ways to attack and gain distance in fencing. 
                    First, make sure you are in on guard position. Next, extend your arm outward. It's 
                    crucial that you extend your arm first as in foil and saber it establishes your right of 
                    way and it increases your accuracy. Then, lift your toes of your front foot, similar to 
                    the advance. Kick your front foot forward while pushing off with your back leg until
                    it is straight. Finally, land with your front heel while extending your back arm to 
                    maintain balance. If you have lunged correctly, then your front knee will be directly 
                    over your front foot and your back leg will be fully extended.                     
                </p>

                <!-- parry -->
                 <h2>Parry 4</h2>
                 <p>
                    A parry is a defensive action where a fencer blocks their opponent's attack. 
                    There are a couple of different types of parries, numbered one to eight, but 
                    the most commonly used one, especially in foil, is parry four. When your opponent 
                    extends their arm to attack, use the forte of the blade (the lower half) to firmly 
                    block the opponent's blade. 
                 </p>
