                <p>
                    From Inigo Montoya and Westley's epic duel in <i>The Princess Bride</i> to 
                    Wednesday Addams' Epee spare in <i>Wednesday</i>, fencing has become an iconic sport in 
                    movies and shows. While modern fencing may differ from its depiction on TV, this core 
                    Olympic sport is enjoyed and practiced by thousands of people across the world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While fencing can be fun and rewarding, between its rules, three disciplines, 
                    and variety of equipment, getting started can feel overwhelming for a beginner. To make 
                    your introduction to fencing feel less dizzying, this site serves as an overview of the
                    sport! Learn more about the disciplines, gear, and techniques by navigating the site.

                    <h2>Disciplines</h2>
                    <p>
                        In fencing, there are three disciplines: foil, epee, and saber. Each has unique
                        qualities that make the style different from the rest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Foil</b>
                        <br>
                        Foil is the style that most beginners start with--not because it is easy--but 
                        because it emphasizes having good point control and technique. Foil has 
                        the smallest target area of the three as you can only score a point by touching
                        your opponent's torso with the tip of the blade. Right of way, which determines 
                        which fencer got the point when they both get a touch at the same time, is also important 
                        to foil. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Saber</b>
                        <br>
                        In saber, the whole upper body is target area and you score points by touching your 
                        opponent with any part of the blade. Because of this, slashing is the primary way of 
                        scoring points, unlike thrusting in foil and epee. Saber also uses right of way, just 
                        like foil, for when two fencers get a touch at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Epee</b>
                        <br>
                        In epee, the whole body is target area, making it have the most target area of the three 
                        weapons. Similarly to foil, only the tip of the blade is used to score points, so there 
                        is no slashing. Unlike foil and saber, there is no right of way. This means that if both 
                        fencers get a touch at the same time, then they both get a point.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Gear</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>White Uniform</b>
                        <br>
                        No matter what style you are fencing, the same white uniform is used. This includes
                        a jacket, knickers, plastron, knee high socks, and a chest protector if you are female. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Weapon Specific Gear</b>
                        <br>
                        On top of the basic white uniform, each discipline has its own gear it uses. The most 
                        important difference is the weapon and the lame. 
                        <br>
                        In foil, the weapon is light-weight, with a button 
                        on its tip that allows the fencer to score a point when it is clicked against their 
                        opponent's target area. The style also uses a lame, which is a conductive jacket that 
                        only covers the target area, which is the torso.
                        <br>
                        The weapon used in saber is full fully conductive, which allows a fencer to score a point 
                        as long as any part of the blade touches their opponent's target area. Saber also uses a 
                        lame, which covers the torso and the sleeves. The mask in saber is fully conductive as well, 
                        since it is target area. 
                        <br>
                        Similar to foil, the weapon in Epee has a button at the tip which forces the fencer to only 
                        score points with the tip of the foil. Since the whole body is alread target area, no lame 
                        is worn. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Techniques</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many different types of techniques used in fencing. A few of the 
                        most fundamental are on guard, advancing, retreating, lunging and parrying.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>On Guard</b> 
                        <br>
                        On guard is the ready stance in fencing. To start a bout, you must be in 
                        on guard position. This involves having your front foot facing toward your 
                        opponent while your back foot is shoulder width apart and perpendicular to
                        the front foot. Then, your legs should be slightly bent. This position 
                        allows for good balance and all other techniques done it fencing are done 
                        from on guard. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Advance and Retreating</b>
                        <br>
                        Advancing is the forward motion in fencing and retreating is the backward 
                        motion. To advance, you first move your front foot and then the back foot 
                        follows. This is the same, but opposite for retreating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Lunging</b>
                        <br>
                        Lunging allows you to cover a lot of distance and make an attack. To lunge, 
                        you first extend your arm toward your opponent. Then, your lift your front foot 
                        and push off with your back leg into a lunge position. Finally, you extend 
                        your back arm to maintain balance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Parrying</b>
                        <br>
                        A parry is a defensive action that blocks the opponents attack. Sometimes, 
                        it is followed by a riposte, which is when you parry and then touch the 
                        opponent back. 
                        In fencing there are eight types of parries, some of which are only used in 
                        specific disciplines.
                        One of the most commonly used parries is parry 4.
