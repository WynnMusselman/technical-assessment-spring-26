## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [x] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [x] An interesting and beautiful frontend design with a catchy title and cool fonts and colors that looks good on any screen size.
- [x] A home page with a summary about the interesting thing you want to teach me about. I was originally planning for this to be purely academic (e.g. math, CS, physics, engineering) topics but I am expanding it to include anything. However, you should be able to teach about whatever you choose in a clear way and go in-depth about it. If your subject matter is particularly engaging, that will reflect positively on your application.
- [x] Extra pages with more detailed information on certain topics. Make your website intuitive to navigate through, both within the pages themselves and in your choice of pages. You can structure your website however you see fit.
- [x] A poll/quiz feature where you can check that the user is aborbing the information your website teaches about well. These quiz questions should be scattered throughout the website, and they should tell the user whether they got the answer right or not once they select it. Additionally, it should show a live count of results (like a social media poll) with the names of the users who have voted for each option. You should take time to make sure your UI for this component is intuitive to use while still including all of the features listed. A user should be able to change their result if they want, and this should be reflected in the result count.
- [x] A comment feature on each page where users can offer feedback or ask questions based on the lesson on the page. The home page does not need a comment section, but every other page should have one.
- [x] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**
I enjoyed creating this project since it gave me the opportunity to be creative and learn more about a topic I am passionate about. I found myself best at structuring and styling the content of the website. Since I have had teaching opportunities in the past, I was best at wording the information in way that would teach a beginner on my topic. I enjoyed styling the website the most though, as it allowed me to be creative in the way I displayed the content. 
  
3. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**
I found this technical assessment to be difficult, but enjoyable, which met my expectations. The most challenging aspect for me was adding the comment section and quizzes to each page since it took me some time and effort to figure out a solution. Given more time, I would improve the styling of the website as well as improve the javascript. I focused too heavily on the actual information of the site at first, which gave me less time to add styling and interactivity. If I had another two weeks, I would work on the CSS to make the website more visually interesting and work on the back end further.
