# Impact Team Technical Assessment Spring 2026 

My submission for BU Hack4Impact's Impact Team technical assessment is a website that teaches the fundamentals of fencing. The website includes in depth descriptions on each topic, images to help teach the user, and a comment section and quiz on each page.
